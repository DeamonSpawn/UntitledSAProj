Completed:
1. Using the StreamingAPI to fetch tweets
2. Analyzing sentiment (algorithm validity needs to be checked)
3. Plotting analysis

TODO:
1. Build a parsing engine. This engine would accept user input, validate it and generate a structured query to be passed to the tweet extractor.
2. Build a tweet extractor. The tweet extractor would parse the structured query and begin fetching tweets, the tweets should be backed up with a data store. Either a database such as MongoDB or even a flat file.
3. Build an opinion miner engine. The miner should pull tweets from the data store and process them to generate some statistics.
4. Build a presenter. The presented takes the generated data and plots graphs, generates reports, etc.

5. All this needs to be deployed on a web server. Consider using a python framework to setting up a web app.

NOTE: Create test cases for every component.
