Project Roadmap:

AM > A system identifies and categorizes opinions expressed about a specific topic/subject on twitter.

Q. Who is the intended audience of the product?
AM > [Fill this up]

Q. What are the other opinion mining projects that have been created?
AM > [Fill this up]

Q. How is your project different from existing work?
AM > Do you have your own implementation of opinion mining? Are you improving an existing project? 

Q. How does the system work?
AM > Give a high level description of how a user would use the system. For example, the user is provided a searchbox where he types in his/her query. and then the system processes his/her request to generate some graphs etc.

Q. What type of queries will the system accept?
AM > What is the query structure? What is the criteria for acceptable queries? How do you handle invalid queries?

Q. Would there be a syntax for queries?
AM > Would the user have to use a query syntax or would he provide a query in english and then the system would parse it?

Q. Are there limitations of query parsing?
AM > What would be categorized as valid queries and invalid queries?

Q. Would tweet collection be realtime or would the user have to specify a time period?
AM > Fill your response here. I'm guessing its going to be realtime, since your using the Streaming API.

Q. How many tweets are being collected or for what duration of time will tweets be collected?
AM > [Fill this up]

Q. How are you mining the tweets for opinions?
AM > Describe the algorithm you're using to process the fetched tweets.

Q. What are the limitations of the algorithm?
AM > Describe limitations if any.

Q. What is the output from processing the tweets?
AM > Describe the statistics that would be generated from processing the tweets.

Q. How will users access the system?
AM > Will it be a web app? Mobile app? I would suggest building a web app and not bother with the mobile app.
